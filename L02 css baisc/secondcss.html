		Whose woods these are I think I know.<br/>
		His house is in the village though;<br/>
		He will not see me stopping <br/>
		To watch his woods <span class="keyword">fill up</span> with snow.<br/>
		My little horse must think it queer<br/>
		To stop without a farmhouse near<br/>
		Between the woods and frozen lake<br/>
		The darkest evening of the year.<br/>
		He gives his harness bells a shake<br/>
		To ask if there is some mistake.<br/>
		The only other sound’s the sweep<br/>
		Of easy wind and downy flake.<br/>
		The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br/>
		But I have promises to keep,<br/>
		And miles to go before I sleep,<br/>
		And miles to go before I sleep.<br/>

	<div class="content">
		Some<span style="color:red;position:relative;top:-5px">2</span> say the world will end in fire,<br/>
		Some say in ice.<br/>
		From what I’ve tasted of desire<br/>
		I hold with those who favor fire.<br/>
		But if it had to <span class="keyword">perish twice</span>,<br/>
		I think I know enough of hate<br/>
		To say that for destruction ice<br/>
		Is also great<br/>
		And would suffice.<br/>
