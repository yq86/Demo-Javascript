# My first journal of coding 

 In my [lesson 1](https://github.com/yq86/Demo-Javascript/blob/master/L1%20html%20basic/last.html), I learned how to add a photo, some links and created a table in HTML.

 In my [lesson 10](https://github.com/yq86/Demo-Javascript/tree/master/L10%20Javascript%20%E5%8F%98%E6%95%B0%E4%B8%8E%E8%BF%90%E7%AE%97%E5%AD%90), I learned the defination of variables and operators.

 In my [lesson 2](https://github.com/yq86/Demo-Javascript/blob/master/L2%20css%20baisc/thirdtry.html), I learned the defination of class selector and added some content and a box on my page by writing CSS.
 
  In my [lesson 3](https://github.com/yq86/Demo-Javascript/blob/master/L3%20css%20selector/css3.html), I learned some more about css selectors.

  In my [lesson 4](https://github.com/yq86/Demo-Javascript/tree/master/L4%20css%20form), I made a relatively nicer table.
  
  In my [lesson 5](https://github.com/yq86/Demo-Javascript/tree/master/L5%20website%20Layout), I made a web page with 3 boxes in the middle and a joke in each as contents. 
  
  In my [lesson 6]https://github.com/yq86/Demo-Javascript/tree/master/L6%20%E5%9B%9E%E5%BA%94%E5%BC%8F%E6%8E%92%E7%89%88%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1), based on lesson 5, I learned about RWD(responsive web design), to suit phone screens.
