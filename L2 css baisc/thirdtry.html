	<div class="title"> “Ozymandias” by Percy Bysshe Shelley</div>
	<div class="content">
		I met a traveller from an antique land<br/>
		Who said: `Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br/>
		Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,<br/>
		Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br/>
		And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br/>
		Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br/>
		Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br/>
		The hand that <span class="keyword">mocked</span> them and the heart that fed.<br/>
		And on the pedestal these words appear —<br/>
		“My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:<br/>
		Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!”<br/>
		Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br/>
		Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare<br/>
		The lone and level sands stretch far away.’.<br/>

	<div class="title">“Warning” by Jenny Joseph</div>
	<div class="content">
		When I<span style="position:relative;top:-7px;color:brown">3</span> am an old woman I shall wear purple<br/>
		With a red hat which doesn’t go, and doesn’t suit me.<br/>
		And I shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves<br/>
		And satin sandals, and say we’ve no money for butter.<br/>
		I shall sit down on the pavement when I’m tired<br/>
		And gobble up samples in shops and press alarm bells<br/>
		And run my stick along the public railings<br/>
		And make up for the sobriety of my youth.<br/>
		I shall go out in my <span class="keyword">slippers</span> in the rain<br/>
		And pick flowers in other people’s gardens<br/>
		And learn to spit.<br/>
		You can wear terrible shirts and grow more fat<br/>
		Or only bread and pickle for a week<br/>
		And hoard pens and pencils and beermats and things in boxes.<br/>
		But now we must have clothes that keep us dry<br/>
		And pay our rent and not swear in the street<br/>
		And set a good example for the children.<br/>
		We must have friends to dinner and read the papers.<br/>
		But maybe I ought to practice a little now?<br/>
		So people who know me are not too shocked and surprised<br/>
		When suddenly I am old, and start to wear purple.<br/>
